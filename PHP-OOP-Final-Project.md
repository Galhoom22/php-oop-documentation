purpose: >
  This file has exactly one purpose: to guide one realistic final project that
  proves the student understands the PHP OOP lecture track and the PHP OOP
  interview-question track.
scope: >
  This file should only contain the final project plan, milestones, validation
  checklist, folder conventions, and mentor rules for the PHP OOP final project.
description: >
  Structured final-project guide for building one real-world PHP OOP project
  after finishing the lectures and interview questions. Trigger this skill when
  the student says "start final project", "continue final project", "review my
  final project", or asks to validate their PHP OOP understanding through a
  practical project.
triggers:
  - user wants to start the PHP OOP final project
  - user wants to continue the PHP OOP final project
  - user wants a real-world PHP OOP practice project
  - user wants to test whether they truly understand PHP OOP
  - user asks for project review after finishing lectures and interview questions

# PHP OOP Final Project (PHP 8.5+) - SupportDesk Lite

## When To Start

Do not start this project yet.

Start only after:
1. All 31 lectures in `PHP-OOP-Lectures.md` are completed.
2. All 31 interview questions in `PHP-OOP-Interview-Questions.md` are completed.
3. The student explicitly says they are ready to start the final project.

This project is the final proof step. It is not a lecture replacement.

---

## Project Summary

Build **SupportDesk Lite**, a small customer-support ticketing system.

This is a real-world type of project used by SaaS products, e-commerce stores, hosting companies, internal IT teams, and service businesses.

The project stays intentionally small:
- No framework.
- No database required at first.
- No web UI required.
- No authentication system required.
- No giant architecture.

The goal is not to build a huge product. The goal is to prove that the student can design and write a complete object-oriented PHP application from scratch.

---

## Student Role

The student writes all project code.

The mentor may:
- Explain requirements.
- Ask design questions.
- Review code written by the student.
- Point out missing concepts.
- Suggest the next small step.
- Help debug errors after the student shares code or error output.

The mentor must not:
- Write complete solution files.
- Create the student's `.php` implementation files.
- Build the project on behalf of the student.
- Skip the student's design decisions.
- Turn this into a framework or design-pattern course.

---

## Business Scenario

A small SaaS company needs a simple support system.

Customers can open support tickets. Support agents can reply, assign tickets, change priority, and close tickets. The system stores tickets in memory first, then later saves and loads them from a file.

The business wants to answer questions like:
- What tickets are still open?
- Which tickets are urgent?
- Which agent owns a ticket?
- What happened in the ticket conversation?
- Can the ticket be exported, restored, and tested safely?

---

## Core Features

The finished project must support these actions:

1. Create a customer.
2. Create a support agent.
3. Create a ticket with a title, description, priority, and customer.
4. Assign a ticket to an agent.
5. Add public replies to a ticket.
6. Add internal notes visible only to agents.
7. Change ticket status: `Open`, `Pending`, `Resolved`, `Closed`.
8. Change ticket priority: `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Urgent`.
9. List tickets by status.
10. List urgent tickets.
11. Close a ticket safely.
12. Prevent invalid state changes.
13. Store tickets behind a repository interface.
14. Switch between in-memory storage and file storage.
15. Send notifications through a notification interface.
16. Export and restore ticket data.
17. Write focused tests for the most important behavior.

---

## Required Folder Structure

The student will write project files inside `Final-Project/`.

```
Final-Project/
  README.md
  composer.json                  // Student-created when Composer is introduced
  src/
    Domain/
      Tickets/
        Ticket.php
        TicketId.php
        TicketStatus.php
        TicketPriority.php
        TicketMessage.php
        PublicReply.php
        InternalNote.php
      Users/
        User.php
        Customer.php
        SupportAgent.php
      Shared/
        Timestampable.php
    Contracts/
      TicketRepository.php
      Notifier.php
      Exporter.php
    Infrastructure/
      Storage/
        InMemoryTicketRepository.php
        FileTicketRepository.php
      Notifications/
        EmailNotifier.php
        LogNotifier.php
      Export/
        JsonTicketExporter.php
    Application/
      TicketService.php
      TicketSearchService.php
    Exceptions/
      TicketNotFoundException.php
      InvalidTicketStateException.php
      UnauthorizedTicketActionException.php
    Attributes/
      Sensitive.php
      AuditAction.php
  tests/
    TicketTest.php
    TicketServiceTest.php
    RepositoryTest.php
  playground.php                 // Student-created manual test runner
  notes.md                       // Student's design notes and final reflection
```

This structure is a target, not a starting dump. The student creates files gradually as each milestone requires them.

---

## Development Rules

1. Use PHP 8.5+.
2. Use `declare(strict_types=1);` in files that use type declarations.
3. Use namespaces and PSR-4 style organization.
4. Use one class, interface, enum, or trait per file.
5. Keep each class focused on one clear responsibility.
6. Do not introduce a database until the file-storage version works.
7. Do not use Laravel, Symfony, or another framework.
8. Do not copy a ready-made ticketing system.
9. Do not add features outside the checklist until the core project is complete.
10. Every important rule must be enforced by code, not by comments.

---

## Milestone Plan

### Milestone 0 - Project Setup

**Goal:** Create the project workspace and explain the first design.

The student must create:
- `Final-Project/README.md`
- `Final-Project/notes.md`
- A first draft of the folder structure.

The student must answer:
- What problem does this project solve?
- What are the main objects in the system?
- Which parts are domain logic and which parts are infrastructure?

Completion check:
- The student can explain the project in plain English without code.

---

### Milestone 1 - First Objects

**Goal:** Build the smallest useful domain model.

The student must create:
- `Ticket`
- `Customer`
- `SupportAgent`

Required concepts:
- Class vs. object
- Properties
- Methods
- Constructor
- `$this`
- Type declarations

Behavior to implement:
- Create a customer.
- Create an agent.
- Create a ticket.
- Print or inspect ticket information manually.

Completion check:
- The student can explain which values belong as properties and which actions belong as methods.

---

### Milestone 2 - Encapsulation and Validation

**Goal:** Protect ticket data from invalid changes.

Required concepts:
- `public`, `private`, and `protected`
- Encapsulation
- Validation
- Property hooks when useful
- Asymmetric visibility when useful

Behavior to implement:
- A ticket title cannot be empty.
- A ticket description cannot be empty.
- A ticket status cannot be changed directly from outside.
- A ticket ID can be read from outside but not changed from outside.

Completion check:
- The student can explain why public mutable properties would be dangerous here.

---

### Milestone 3 - Enums and Safe State

**Goal:** Replace fragile strings with safe states.

The student must create:
- `TicketStatus`
- `TicketPriority`

Required concepts:
- Enums
- Type hints with enums
- `from()` and `tryFrom()` when converting raw values

Behavior to implement:
- Allowed statuses: `Open`, `Pending`, `Resolved`, `Closed`.
- Allowed priorities: `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Urgent`.
- Invalid raw status values must not silently enter the system.

Completion check:
- The student can explain why enums are safer than plain strings for ticket status.

---

### Milestone 4 - Inheritance and Shared User Behavior

**Goal:** Use inheritance only where it is truly meaningful.

The student must create:
- An abstract or base `User`
- `Customer`
- `SupportAgent`

Required concepts:
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- `parent::`
- Protected members only when justified
- Final methods when behavior must not be changed

Behavior to implement:
- Both customers and agents have a name and email.
- Agents have an agent level or department.
- Customers and agents may display their identity differently.

Completion check:
- The student can explain why `Customer` and `SupportAgent` can share a parent, and what should not be placed in that parent.

---

### Milestone 5 - Interfaces and Polymorphism

**Goal:** Make storage and notifications replaceable.

The student must create:
- `TicketRepository`
- `Notifier`
- `InMemoryTicketRepository`
- `LogNotifier`

Required concepts:
- Interfaces
- Implementing multiple interfaces when useful
- Polymorphism
- Type hints against interfaces

Behavior to implement:
- `TicketService` saves tickets through `TicketRepository`.
- `TicketService` sends notifications through `Notifier`.
- The service must not know the concrete storage or notification class.

Completion check:
- The student can explain how a new notifier can be added without changing the service logic.

---

### Milestone 6 - Abstract Classes, Traits, and Reuse

**Goal:** Share useful behavior without forcing the wrong relationship.

The student may create:
- `TicketMessage`
- `PublicReply`
- `InternalNote`
- `Timestampable`

Required concepts:
- Abstract classes
- Traits
- Trait conflict awareness
- Constructor reuse

Behavior to implement:
- Public replies and internal notes share message text and creation date.
- Public replies and internal notes differ in visibility or display behavior.
- Repeated timestamp behavior is handled cleanly.

Completion check:
- The student can explain why a trait may be better than inheritance for timestamp behavior.

---

### Milestone 7 - Exceptions and Business Rules

**Goal:** Make failure explicit and understandable.

The student must create:
- `TicketNotFoundException`
- `InvalidTicketStateException`
- `UnauthorizedTicketActionException`

Required concepts:
- Exceptions
- Custom exceptions
- `try`, `catch`, and `finally`
- `Throwable` awareness

Behavior to implement:
- Closing an already closed ticket throws a clear exception.
- Assigning a ticket to an invalid agent throws a clear exception.
- Searching for a missing ticket throws a clear exception.

Completion check:
- The student can explain when to return `null` and when to throw an exception.

---

### Milestone 8 - Static Members, Constants, and Late Static Bindings

**Goal:** Use class-level behavior carefully.

Required concepts:
- Static methods
- Static properties
- Class constants
- `self::` vs. `static::`
- Late static bindings

Possible behavior:
- A base ID generator class with child-specific prefixes.
- Constants for system limits, such as maximum title length.
- Static factory methods for creating ticket IDs or messages.

Completion check:
- The student can explain when static behavior is useful and when it can make testing harder.

---

### Milestone 9 - Object References, Cloning, and Readonly Objects

**Goal:** Prove understanding of object identity and immutable values.

The student must create or use:
- A readonly `TicketId`
- Cloning behavior for safe ticket snapshots

Required concepts:
- Object handles
- Assignment vs. cloning
- `clone`
- `__clone`
- Readonly classes or readonly properties
- Immutability

Behavior to implement:
- Changing one ticket variable affects the same object when it references the same instance.
- Cloning a ticket snapshot prevents accidental changes to the original.
- Ticket IDs cannot be modified after creation.

Completion check:
- The student can explain the difference between equal objects and the same object.

---

### Milestone 10 - Magic Methods, Object Comparison, and Serialization

**Goal:** Use PHP object behavior intentionally.

Required concepts:
- `__toString`
- `__get` or `__set` only if there is a clear reason
- `__serialize` and `__unserialize`
- `==` vs. `===`
- Object serialization risks

Behavior to implement:
- `Ticket` can be converted to a short readable string.
- Ticket export does not leak internal-only notes unless explicitly allowed.
- The student can compare two tickets and explain the result.

Completion check:
- The student can explain why magic methods should not hide important behavior.

---

### Milestone 11 - Namespaces, Autoloading, and File Storage

**Goal:** Turn separate files into a small organized application.

Required concepts:
- Namespaces
- `use`
- PSR-4 style autoloading
- `spl_autoload_register` or Composer autoloading

Behavior to implement:
- Classes live in matching folders and namespaces.
- The app can run from `playground.php`.
- `FileTicketRepository` can save and load ticket data from a file.

Completion check:
- The student can map a namespace like `App\Domain\Tickets\Ticket` to its file path.

---

### Milestone 12 - Attributes, Anonymous Classes, Object Iteration, and Lazy Objects

**Goal:** Touch the advanced features in a realistic but small way.

Required concepts:
- Attributes
- Anonymous classes
- Object iteration
- Lazy objects or lazy initialization

Possible behavior:
- Mark sensitive fields with a `Sensitive` attribute.
- Mark important service methods with an `AuditAction` attribute.
- Use an anonymous notifier in one manual test.
- Make file storage initialize lazily only when first used.
- Make a ticket collection iterable.

Completion check:
- The student can explain which advanced features added value and which ones should not be overused.

---

### Milestone 13 - Testing

**Goal:** Prove the project works with focused tests.

Required concepts:
- PHPUnit
- Assertions
- Testing exceptions
- Testing classes through public behavior

Minimum tests:
- A ticket can be created with valid data.
- Empty ticket title is rejected.
- Ticket status transitions work correctly.
- Invalid ticket transition throws an exception.
- `TicketService` works with an in-memory repository.
- A missing ticket throws `TicketNotFoundException`.

Completion check:
- The student can explain what each test protects from breaking later.

---

### Milestone 14 - Final Review

**Goal:** Prove understanding, not only working code.

The student must write `Final-Project/notes.md` with answers to:
- What are the most important classes in the project?
- Where did you use encapsulation?
- Where did you use polymorphism?
- Where did you use inheritance, and why was it justified?
- Which interface made the project easier to change?
- Which exception represents a real business failure?
- Which enum prevented invalid data?
- Which class was easiest to test, and why?
- What would you improve if this became a real production project?

Completion check:
- The student can explain the whole project from memory.
- The student can answer interview-style questions about every major design choice.

## Mentor Session Flow

Use this flow each time the student works on the final project.

### PLAN

Ask:
- Which milestone are you working on?
- What files did you create or change?
- What behavior should work now?

### DO

The student writes the code.

The mentor may explain the next step but must not write the implementation.

### CHECK

The mentor asks one focused question or gives one small verification task.

Examples:
- "Show me where invalid ticket status is prevented."
- "Which interface lets you replace storage?"
- "What happens if this ticket is already closed?"

### ACT

- If correct: mark the milestone as complete.
- If partially correct: name the missing concept and ask for one focused change.
- If stuck: reduce the task to a smaller version.
