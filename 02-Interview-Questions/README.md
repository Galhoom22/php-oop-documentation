purpose: >
  This file has exactly one purpose: to serve as the single learning source for
  realistic PHP OOP interview questions after the PHP OOP lectures are complete.
scope: >
  This file should only contain interview-question guidance, progress, practice
  rules, and folder conventions related to PHP OOP interview preparation.
description: >
  Structured, iterative interview-preparation skill for PHP OOP. Trigger this
  skill when the student wants PHP OOP interview questions, asks to practice
  interview answers, says "next interview question", or wants to review common
  real-world PHP OOP questions after finishing the lecture track.
triggers:
  - user asks for PHP OOP interview questions
  - user wants to practice PHP OOP interview answers
  - user says "next interview question"
  - user asks what PHP OOP questions can appear in interviews
  - user wants code-based PHP OOP interview practice

# PHP OOP Interview Questions (PHP 8.5+) - Iterative Practice Track

## Who This Is For

Student profile: finished or is close to finishing the PHP OOP lecture track, understands basic PHP syntax, and wants to prepare for realistic PHP OOP interview questions.

---

## Interview Questions Track (42 Questions, One Per Session)

Start this track only after Lecture 31 in `../01-Lectures/README.md` is complete. It prepares the student for realistic PHP OOP interview questions. Deliver exactly one interview question per session unless the student explicitly asks to continue.

Every interview question must be handled like a lecture:
- Understand the question first.
- Explain what the interviewer is really testing.
- Build the answer step by step.
- Write code only when the answer genuinely needs code.
- Ask one CHECK task at the end.
- Mark the question with ✅ only after the student can answer it clearly and pass the practice task.
- Always keep a `Source:` line at the end of each question folder's `README.md`, pointing to the reference used for that question.

This track stays inside PHP OOP. Do not teach design patterns, SOLID, or broad OOD theory here; those belong to the separate OOD course.

### Interview Track Review Checklist

Use this checklist before moving from the interview-question track to the final project.

```
- [ ] Every interview question from 1 to 42 is marked with ✅ in the progress list.
- [ ] Every question folder has a `README.md`.
- [ ] Every question folder `README.md` ends with a `Source:` or `Sources:` line.
- [ ] Every completed question folder has `Status: Completed`.
- [ ] The student can answer each question out loud in interview style.
- [ ] The student can explain the code-based questions without copying the answer.
- [ ] The student can connect each interview question back to the related lecture.
- [ ] The student has written `notes.md` for any question that felt difficult.
- [ ] Weak questions were repeated until the student could answer clearly and confidently.
```

Do not start `../03-Final-Project/README.md` until this checklist is complete.

## Interview Question Session Cycle

### PLAN

Before answering, state:
- The exact interview question.
- The real skill the interviewer is testing.
- Which lecture or lectures this question depends on.

### DO

Teach the answer in this order:
- Start with a plain-English answer that could be said in an interview.
- Explain each important term before using it deeply.
- If code is needed, show the smallest possible PHP 8.5+ example first.
- Annotate every line of every code snippet.
- Then improve the answer into a stronger interview-ready version.

### CHECK

Ask one targeted task:
- For theory questions: ask the student to answer in their own words.
- For code questions: ask the student to write or fix one small code example.

Wait for the student's answer before moving on.

### ACT

- Correct answer: confirm it, give a polished interview answer, and mark the question with ✅ in the progress list.
- Partially correct: identify the missing point, re-teach only that point, then re-ask the CHECK task.
- Stuck: return to the simplest analogy, give a smaller version of the question, then re-ask.

---

## Code Standards

All code shown or practiced in this track must follow these rules:

1. PHP version: target PHP 8.5 or newer.
2. Every code block must start with `<?php` and include `declare(strict_types=1);` when type hints are used.
3. Naming: PascalCase for class names, camelCase for methods and properties, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
4. Keep code examples focused on the interview question.
5. Annotate every line of every code snippet. Zero uncommented lines.
6. Every code block has a label above it stating what file it belongs to.
7. Do not pre-write final `.php` solution files for the student. The student writes practice code during the question session.

---

## Source Reference Rules

Every interview question must include a source reference, similar to the lecture `PHP Manual Reference` rule.

- Each question folder's `README.md` must end with a `Source:` line.
- Use the official PHP Manual when the question is about PHP language behavior.
- Use official tool documentation when the question is about a tool, such as PHPUnit.
- If one question depends on more than one official page, write `Sources:` and include all relevant links.
- The source line must be the final line in the `README.md`.

Only `README.md` is created as a scaffold. The `.php` files and `notes.md` files are created only when the student works through that question.

---

## Question Folder Rules

Each question folder contains a `README.md` with:
- The exact interview question.
- The related lecture or lectures.
- What the interviewer is testing.
- What a strong answer should cover.
- A practice task.
- The completion rule.
- The source reference as the final line.

When a question is completed:
1. Update its folder `README.md` status from `Not completed` to `Completed`.
2. Mark the matching question with ✅ in the progress list in this file.
3. If code was practiced, keep the student's code inside that question folder.

---

## What Not To Do

- Do not answer more than one interview question per session unless the student explicitly asks to continue.
- Do not turn the track into generic career advice.
- Do not teach design patterns, SOLID, or broad OOD theory in this file.
- Do not pre-write final answers before the student tries the CHECK task.
- Do not create `.php` solution files unless the student is actively working through that question.
- Do not move lecture curriculum content into this file.
